# Kelp Forest Generated Scene
by Keenan rea

a small scene which depicts and undewrater kelp forest with  kelp, rocks, 
and fish; all of which are generated randomly. Fish and kelp react to mouse 
position by moving and leaning respectively, in an attempt to simulate current.

The patterns I am attempting to emulate are the uneven but consistent spacing on the kelp,
the constant jumble of rocks at the bottom, and the occasional fish somewhere in the scene.


Artist Statement:
What I wanted to acheive was the feeling of the flow of the water. I did this by making
the fish move from left to right, but I had to make the kelp lean so that it was clear
that the scene wasn't just scrolling by. Unfortunately the fish also move backwards; I could
have animated the fish moving left to right constantly and changed their speed based on the 
leaning of the kelp for a better effect.
